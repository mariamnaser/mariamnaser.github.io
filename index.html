          <h2>Introduction: Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I am Mariam Naser, a dedicated Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Arts at Columbia University, Barnard College, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in data structures, advanced programming, and computational linear algebra, while also exploring my passion for philosophy through a minor. Beyond the classroom, my practical experience as an Assistant at the Columbia Nano Initiative has honed my attention to detail and organizational skills, particularly in the realm of financial data management. My technical strengths encompass a variety of programming languages, including Java and Python, and proficiency in tools like Git, SQL, and Linux. I've also demonstrated my problem-solving skills through projects such as the development of a file sharing app and a Reliable UDP File Transfer system. With a commitment to community involvement, including teaching climbing and safety skills and web design contributions, I am passionate about making technology accessible and impactful for diverse audiences.
